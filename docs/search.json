    "text": "Emma is a MS student in the department of Horticulture and Landscape Architecture. She received her Bachelor’s Degree in Plant Sciences from the University of Florida in 2019, where she worked with invasive plant ecology as an undergraduate researcher. After her undergraduate degree, Emma pursued plant conservation in Madagascar, New England, Hawai’i, and Colorado. After gaining an interest in regenerative agriculture from food forest operations in Denver and Hawai’i, she is currently researching the root microbiomes of legumes in different agricultural systems. Her goal is to create adaptable plant-microbe interactions to combat climate change in agricultural systems."
